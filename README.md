# YouTube Unsubscriber

https://vassilevsky.github.io/youtube-unsubscriber/

Lets you quickly unsubscribe from channels on YouTube.
YouTube itself has no easy way of doing it.
This is understandable.

## Features

* No dependencies. This is truly a single page application :)
* Modern JavaScript. Fetch API, ES6. No transpiling.
* One-by-one channel analysis. You can load channel's videos if you don't remember what it has.

## To do

* Load all pages of the channel list. YouTube Data API has a limit of 50 items per page.
* Some styling.

I might accept pull requests with these.
